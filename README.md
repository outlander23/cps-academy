## Setup Instructions

### Backend

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd cps/backend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Setup environment variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure as needed.

3. **Configure MongoDB**
   - Local: Install and start MongoDB (e.g. `brew install mongodb-community`)
   - Cloud: Create a cluster at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), update `MONGODB_URI` in `.env`

4. **Seed the database**
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

5. **Start backend server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   API runs at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

### Frontend

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd cps/frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure API URL (optional)**
   - Create `.env` and set `VITE_API_URL` if backend is running elsewhere.

3. **Start frontend**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Frontend expects backend at `http://localhost:4000`.
